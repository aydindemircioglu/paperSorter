paperSorter v0.1
	by aydin demircioglu, 2014
	
this small utility will query google to try to determine author and name a given pdf of a (scientific) paper.

requirements:
	python
		pdfminer
		PDFDocument
		unidecode
	
	install the needed modules via
	
# sudo pip install pdfminer
# sudo pip install PDFDocument
# sudo pip install unidecode

	(drop sudo, if not root)
	

problems/todos:
	-google scholar will at some point claim that the script is a robot and refuse to provide information.
		no clear workaround. need either proxies or better query script
	-renaming is fixed
		it will always be name_title.pdf
	-works only in local path
		renaming will put things into local path, so execute at '.' to avoid moving the files
